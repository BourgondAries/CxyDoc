Semantics. Constaints II. It's possible to have different constants for each invocation:

<pre>
naiveLinearSum(sum_to=0):
	limit := sum_to
	total = 0
	for sum_to in 0..limit:
		total += sum_to
	return total

naiveLinearSum(sum_to=100)
naiveLinearSum(sum_to=50)
</pre>

The only thing 'constants' are constrained on is that they simply can not be changed
after first assignment.
