Variables. Assign function pointers. Function pointers are not given a specific type until invocation happens.
<pre>
f(in):
	return in + 10

a = f
print(a(10))
# print(a(64s(10)))  # Error! Not the same type!
</pre>

<pre>
20
</pre>

The reason for picking the type by the invocation is because we want to keep polymorphism
active until the last possible compiled instance. In this case, a becomes a function
pointer to f that takes in exactly 32s.
