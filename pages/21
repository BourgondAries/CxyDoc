Classes. Classes are simply the filenames. The constructor are the free statements of that file.
<pre>
if scan() == "y":
	subobj = new This
else:
	subobj = null
</pre>

Press y two times and you end up with:
<pre>
subobj -> subobj -> subobj -> null
</pre>

The compiler statically inferres the type of subojb (ptr This) so that you can assign null if needed.
