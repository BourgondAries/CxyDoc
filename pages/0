Setup. First compilation.
<p>
To begin programming in Cxy, create a text file and put the following code in the file 'Main.cxy'.
</p>
<p>
Do not include the numbers to the left. They are line numbers.
</p>
<pre>
# Cxy Tutorial
print("Hello World")
</pre>

Compile the code to an executable using
<pre>
cxyc Main.cxy
</pre>

Run that code using
<pre>
./Main
</pre>

Expected output:
<pre>
Hello World
</pre>

Let's dissect the program

<pre>
# Cxy Tutorial
</pre>

This line denotes a comment. All lines starting with # are comments. Comments are fully ignored by the compiler. You can write whatever you want in them.
Comments end with new lines.

<pre>
print("Hello World")
</pre>

<p>
The word print refers to a function called print.
</p>
<p>
The elements after a function name, within parentheses are called arguments.
</p>
<p>
In this case, the argument to print is "Hello World".
</p>
<p>
This prints the string "Hello World" to the standard output.
</p>
<p>
If you run it in the terminal you'll see the string in that terminal.
</p>
<p>
Print is widely used and is your first basic IO skill. Print will be used to check for the state of a program.
</p>

<p>
If you have any trouble, check out the web. You should have cxyc installed on your
computer. If the terminal complains that it can not find cxyc, and you actually did
install it, then check if cxyc is added to PATH Instructions to do this is <a href="http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm">Here</a>.
