First compilation. <br>
Put the following code in the file 'Main.cxy'
<pre>
# Cxy Tutorial
print("Hello World")
</pre>

Compile the code to an executable using
<pre>
cxyc Main.cxy
</pre>

Run that code using
<pre>
./Main
</pre>

Expected output:
<pre>
Hello World
</pre>

If you have any trouble, check out the web. You should have cxyc installed on your
computer. If the terminal complains that it can not find cxyc, and you actually did
install it, then check if cxyc is added to PATH (search about PATH).
