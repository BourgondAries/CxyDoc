Variables. Pointers.
<pre>
a = 100  # Is a 32s type
b = $a  # Is a 'ptr 32s' type
print(@b)
</pre>

<pre>
100
</pre>

A pointer is simply a value that points to a location in memory. Pointers can be used to efficiently move large data structures around. They are also useful when communicating with other systems.

$ means 'get the address of'.
@ means 'dereference the address'.
