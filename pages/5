Variables.
Variables can not <i>shadow</i> outer scopes
<pre>
value = "string"
scope:
	value = 10  # Error! Overwriting a string-typed variable with an integer
	print(value)
</pre>

Look closely at this and the previous example and note the difference: value is declared <strong>before</strong> the scope, so it is included in the scope (it can be used in the scope). This clashes with the integer definition of value.
