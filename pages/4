Variables. Types of Variables.

There are three main types of variables. Integers are one of the three main types.
<h1> Integers </h1>
<pre>
a = 32s(10)
b = 32u(10)
c = 128u(1832948903129879)
d = 1u(true)
e = false
f = 10s(-319)
</pre>

The form of integers is (number (s|u)). The 's' stands for 'signed', which means that one bit is used for a sign (+ and -). Signed numbers support negative numbers. 'u' stands for unsigned, meaning numbers that can not support negative numbers.
