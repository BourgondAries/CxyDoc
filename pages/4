Variables.
Variables are inside scopes. When the scope is exited, the variable that was declared locally is deleted.
<pre>
scope:
	value = 10
	print(value)

value = "string"  # OK
print(value)
</pre>

The two 'value' variables are completely different. A scope is a memory and run-time area that protects (to some extent) from the rest of the program.
