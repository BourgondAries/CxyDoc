Semantics. Constants are useful for ensuring read-only semantics.
<pre>
onlyRead(variable):
	@variable += 1  # TRIES TO EDIT: Error
	print(@variable)  # Allowed, only reading

myvar = new 32s(10)
onlyRead($$@myvar)  # Send a $$ (const-pointer)
</pre>

This will fail to compile. You send in a const-pointer, which means that the data
it is pointing to can not be modified, only read.
