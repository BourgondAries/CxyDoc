Classes. Methods.

Classes also support functions. They are called "methods".
<pre>
# Main.cxy
enter():
	vector = new sub:Sub(x=1, y=2)
	vector->doSomething()
	(@vector).doSomething()
	type vector
	del vector

enter()
</pre>

<pre>
# sub/Sub.cxy
new(this, x, y):
	this->x = x
	this->y = y

del():
	pass

doSomething(this):
	print(this->x)
	print(this->y)
</pre>

The type of vector gives
<pre>
vector: ptr sub:Sub
</pre>

The code prints
<pre>
1
2
</pre>


Note that the destructor is called 'del' and the constructor is called 'new'. These are reuses of the new and del operators.
